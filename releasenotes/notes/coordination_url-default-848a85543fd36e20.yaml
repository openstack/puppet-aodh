deprecations:
  - |
    Default value of the ``aodh::evaluator::coordination_url`` parameter has
    been changed from ``undef`` to ``$::os_service_default``. Usage of
    ``undef`` or false value has been deprecated and will be removed in
    a future release. Use ``$::os_service_default`` instead.
